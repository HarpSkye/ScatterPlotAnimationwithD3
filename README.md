# ScatterPlotAnimationwithD3

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This scatterplot is inspired by <a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-scatterplot-graph'>freeCodeCamp Scatter Plot</a>. You can find the animation at <a href='https://codepen.io/harpskye/pen/RwJmOLm'>my codepen</a>. Or, you can see the animation from <a href='https://harpskye.github.io/ScatterPlotAnimationwithD3'/>here</a>.</p> 
<p>In order to make the work more data related, I decided to add a python script to simply count the doping atheletes. It was quite interesting since I am usually a R person, and feeling the needs to refresh my skills in Python a bit. I won't tell you I got a bit lazy to change my IDE as VSCode. lol </p>

<h3>Personal Challenge</h3>
<p>A few things I felt chanllenging when developing this scatter plot. 
  <ul>
    <li>Refreshing my memory of Python script.</li>
    <li>Centered the entire content with any additional necessary positioning.</li>
    <li>Add the rotated Axis title</li>
    <li>Adding legend</li>
    <li>Adjusting the tooltip position</li>
    <li>Dot sprinkle animation</li>
  </ul>

</p>
<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<p>Here are the a few things that really interested me for my future build:
  <ul>
    <li>D3.ease seems a very intersting concept, and I would like to use that to add more animation in my chart</li>
    <li>I have a tendancy to prepare my data after parsing the JSON file. (The old ETL habit as a Data Scientist) However, that is not necessary. Once the JSON data is ready, it can be directly used in the script. </li>
    <li>I believe it is necessary to create my own QA process when I build any of the chart. Using R or Python to generate the plot. Once I finish my chart in JS, I can do a quick QA and make sure my content look accurate</li>
  </ul>
